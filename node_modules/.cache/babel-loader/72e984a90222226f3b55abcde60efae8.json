While doing a challenging crossword, they may realize that if they take a break and come back to the puzzle, they will end up with a solution faster. This is because although students aren’t consciously solving it, their brain is still working in the background subconsciously. It does most of the hard work for them. Candidates should plan and take timed breaks in between study sessions to prepare for the exam in a better way.</p>\n             \t</div>\n\t\t\t</section>\n            <section id=\"oneneetguide\" class=\"white\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inner\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<header>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Take care of health</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\t\t\t    <p>A complete sleep is the best meditation.
